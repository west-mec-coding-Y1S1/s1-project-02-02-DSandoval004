        <h1>What Your Support Does</h1>

        <p>Every 10 minutes a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer. Her first reaction is fear and confusion. Support is just
            a phone call or mouse click away. Our free services offer a friendly ear and expert guidance to anyone dealing

        <h1>Diane's Run - September 9, 2017</h1>

        <p>Join over 2000 athletes in Cheyenne, Wyoming, for Diane's Run to raise money for breast cancer awareness and research.
            The 5K and 10K races are challenging, yet attainable. You can aim for a personal best while taking part to raise
            money for this important charity. If you can't run, consider walking; joining young and old in the fight by participating
            in the 1-Mile Walk for Hope.</p>


        <h2>How to Join</h2>

        <p>You can guarantee a spot by filling out the entry form and mailing it to
            <a href="mailto:dianesrun@example.com">dianesrun@example.com</a>. The $35 entry fee is tax deductible and goes directly to important research and women
            in need. We keep our overhead very low so every dollar counts. More than 75% of the net proceeds fund screening
            and treatment programs in your communities. We welcome out-of-town visitors. We will help you find
            <a href="faq.html#faq13">accommodations</a>

        <h2>History</h2>

        <p>Since its inception in 2004, Diane's Run has grown from a purely local event involving 100 runners to a signature
            Wyoming event with more than 2000 participants annually. The event is enormously effective in spreading the message
            that breast cancer need not be fatal if caught early enough with mammography and breast self-exam. As well as
            a top-flight athletic event, Diane's Run is an emotionally moving event attracting many first timers and recreational
            runners. This event provides all of us with the opportunity to spread a hopeful message about breast cancer to
            our families and our communities.</p>


        <h2>Remembering Diane</h2>

        <p>Diane's Run is named in remembrance of Diane Wheaton, mother of 2 and wife of Peter, who passed away in May, 2003.
            Diane was an outspoken advocate of physical fitness and healthy living. She was an inspiration to all who knew
            her and continues to be an inspiration to the thousands of runners who have participated in this event.</p>

        <p>We hope you can join us this year and become part of the Diane's Run family.</p>
